# **How did I go from learning html to deploying via github actions**

My fascination for all things cloud started after my first real tech job, working for a traditional hosting company building, nothing really just some sharedboxes, reseller accounts and a few vps. We had one or two enterprise customers. Buddy of the CEO. 
Over all it was a pretty **underwhelming** experience.

Well, there comes a point when you have to codify your world in both career and personal life or face the over whelming dilemma, do I live as I teach or not take my own advice. Thus here we are, 11pm at night, writing another enter into my blog that will auto update and publish its static guts to the *github* repo, and show you beautiful netsetters this very text.

Anyway with just a few commands I can create with this thing called **markdown** and hugo does all these cool bits to format it, make it pretty, and then send it to the interwebs to publish. I linked their getting started page to outline just how *friggen* simple it is to get started. 

I plan to try this with some automation, maybe queue some log files or spit metrics for the server. The possibilities are endless! 

**How did I create this post?**
```bash
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```
Too easy!
