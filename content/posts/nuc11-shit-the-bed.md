# My NUC-11 Shit the bed


It just wont power on, I believe its a psu/system board failure but do not have the tools to inspect. Ordered a [frame.work](https://frame.work/) 12th gen DIY laptop & an egpu case with a 10gb SFP adapter! So while the NUC-11 is going to have to wait, Im using my ROG for now running on Arch. Really look forward to doing this frame.work build and documenting it.

i7-1280p

64gb of DDR4 SO-DIMM

4tb NVME

and 4 beautiful thunderbolt 4 ports for all the accessories! Hoping this will give me the best of portability AND some power flex when I want to game using the egpu.


Stay Tuned!
