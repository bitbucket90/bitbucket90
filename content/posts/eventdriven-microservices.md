# Event Driven Microservies.. O MY!

Event-driven microservices are a design pattern and architectural approach for building software systems. They are based on the idea of breaking down a large, monolithic application into smaller, independent components, called microservices, that communicate with each other through a system of events.

Each microservice is responsible for a specific business capability and is designed to be highly decoupled and autonomous. This allows for faster development and deployment, as well as easier maintenance and scalability.The communication between microservices is done through events, which are messages that are sent between the services to indicate that something has occurred. For example, a microservice that handles user registration may send an event to notify other microservices that a new user has been created.

In this way, microservices can respond to events and trigger actions in other microservices as needed, creating a loosely coupled and highly scalable system.


Event-driven microservices can help a company undergoing digital transformation and adopting more cloud services in several ways:

1. Scalability: Event-driven microservices allow for the easy scaling of individual components, rather than the entire system. This means that resources can be added or removed as needed, without disrupting the entire system. This is especially beneficial for cloud services, which are often used for their scalability.
2. Flexibility: Event-driven microservices allow for a more flexible architecture, as services can be easily added or removed as business needs change. This allows for faster development and deployment of new features and capabilities.
3. Decoupling: With event-driven microservices, the communication between services is done through events, rather than direct calls. This decoupling allows for more resilient and fault-tolerant systems, as microservices can continue to operate independently even if one or more fail.
4. Cloud-native: Event-driven microservices are well-suited for cloud environments, as they are designed to be highly distributed and can take advantage of cloud services such as serverless computing, containerization, and auto-scaling.
5. Cost-effective: By breaking down a monolithic application into smaller, independent microservices, companies can reduce costs by only running and scaling the services that are actually needed, rather than the entire application.

Overall, event-driven microservices can help companies undergoing digital transformation and adopting more cloud services by providing a more flexible, scalable, and cost-effective approach for building and deploying software systems.

In conclusion, event-driven microservices are a powerful tool for companies looking to modernize their technology stack and stay competitive in today's digital landscape. These services provide a number of benefits such as scalability, flexibility, decoupling, cloud-native capabilities, and cost-effectiveness.

Moving to event-driven microservices can allow companies to break down large, monolithic applications into smaller, independent components, making it easier to develop, deploy, and maintain new features and capabilities. It also enables companies to take advantage of the scalability and cost-efficiency of cloud services.

Additionally, event-driven microservices also provide a more resilient and fault-tolerant system, as microservices can continue to operate independently even if one or more fail. This can help companies to avoid costly downtime and ensure continuity of service.

In short, event-driven microservices can help companies to stay agile, adapt to changing business needs, and stay ahead of the curve in terms of technology. It's worth considering for any enterprise looking to take their digital transformation to the next level.

### Here is a quick run down of how youd take something like - Wordpress - and turn it into a microservice.

Turning WordPress into an event-driven microservice architecture would involve breaking down the monolithic WordPress application into smaller, independent microservices that communicate with each other through a system of events. This would involve several steps, such as:

1. [ ] Identifying the core functionalities of WordPress: These would include things like user management, content management, and plugin management.
2. [ ] Decomposing the application into microservices: Each functionality would be separated into its own microservice. For example, the user management functionality would be its own microservice, the content management functionality would be its own microservice, and so on.
3. [ ] Implementing event-driven communication: The microservices would communicate with each other through a system of events. For example, when a new user is created, the user management microservice would send an event to notify the other microservices that a new user has been created. In this way, microservices can respond to events and trigger actions in other microservices as needed.
4. [ ] Containerizing the microservices: The microservices would be containerized using technologies such as Docker, allowing for easy deployment and scaling.
5. [ ] Deployment: The microservices would be deployed to a cloud-based infrastructure, such as Kubernetes, for easier scaling and management.
6. [ ] Re-architecting the front-end: The front-end of the application would need to be re-architected to work with the new microservice architecture.

Please note that this is a high-level overview and the implementation details would vary depending on the specific requirements of the application, and this may require a lot of work, testing, and validation.

Also, you may want to consider if the complexity and effort of this process is worth it or if there are other solutions that can help you to achieve your goals.
